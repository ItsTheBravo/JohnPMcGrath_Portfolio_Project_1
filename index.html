            <h2>From the beginning</h2>
            <p>The PlayStation was released in Japan in December 1994, and it made its American debut in September 1995;
                both releases
                elicited critical acclaim and impressive sales. Titles such as Twisted Metal and Ridge Racer were very
                popular. By 2005
                the PlayStation had become the first console ever to ship 100 million units.</p>
            <p>The original console in the series was the first console of any type to ship over 100 million units,
                doing so in under a
                decade. Its successor, the PlayStation 2, was released in 2000. The PlayStation 2 is the best-selling
                home console to
                date, having reached over 155 million units sold by the end of 2012. Sony's next console, the
                PlayStation 3, was
                released in 2006, selling over 87.4 million units by March 2017. Sony's next console, the PlayStation
                4, was released
                in 2013, selling a million units within a day, becoming the fastest selling console in history. The
                latest console in
                the series, the PlayStation 5, was released in 2020 and sold 10 million units in its first 249 days,
                unseating its
                predecessor as the fastest-selling PlayStation console to-date.</p>

                <p>The PlayStation, one of a new generation of 32-bit consoles, signaled Sony's rise to power in the
                    video game world. Also
                    known as the PS One, the PlayStation used compact discs (CDs), heralding the video game industry's
                    move away from
                    cartridges.

                    first PS2 models came with a 128-bit, 300 MHz Emotion CPU. Also included was a MIPS R3000 chip for
                    I/O handling and
                    backward compatibility with the earlier PlayStation.

                    drive that also
                    reads DVDs, CDs and SACD discs, the PS3 uses the Cell processor, which is considerably more powerful
                    than the CPU in the
                    PlayStation 2 (PS2).
