            <h2>From the beginning</h2>
            <p>The PlayStation was released in Japan in December 1994, and it made its American debut in September 1995;
                both releases
                elicited critical acclaim and impressive sales. Titles such as Twisted Metal and Ridge Racer were very
                popular. By 2005
                the PlayStation had become the first console ever to ship 100 million units.</p>

                <p>The PlayStation, one of a new generation of 32-bit consoles, signaled Sony's rise to power in the
                    video game world. Also
                    known as the PS One, the PlayStation used compact discs (CDs), heralding the video game industry's
                    move away from
                    cartridges.

                    after great

                    first PS2 models came with a 128-bit, 300 MHz Emotion CPU. Also included was a MIPS R3000 chip for
                    I/O handling and
                    backward compatibility with the earlier PlayStation.

                <p>A video game console from Sony that was introduced in late 2006. Containing a high-definition Blu-ray
                    drive that also
                    reads DVDs, CDs and SACD discs, the PS3 uses the Cell processor, which is considerably more powerful
                    than the CPU in the
                    PlayStation 2 (PS2).
